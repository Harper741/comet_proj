trials with the first 100 images, no further criteria

5_h:
100, drawn by sorting the images in order of increasing RA then getting every 13th image so they will be spread out in RA

6_h:
100, drawn by sorting the images in order of increasing RA then getting every 13th image so they will be spread out in RA, but we converted the walkers’ starting points to km rather than AU, which corrects a mistake.

7_h:
same image selection method, but with 145 images

8_h:
same image selection method, but with 77 images

9_h:
same as 6_h, but with 30 integration points

10_h:
same as 6_h, but with 80 integration points and 163 images
