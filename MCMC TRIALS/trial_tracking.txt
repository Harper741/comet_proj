1-4
trials with the first 100 images, no further criteria

5_h:
100, drawn by sorting the images in order of increasing RA then getting every 13th image so they will be spread out in RA, 50 integration points

6_h:
100, drawn by sorting the images in order of increasing RA then getting every 13th image so they will be spread out in RA, but we converted the walkersâ€™ starting points to km rather than AU, which corrects a mistake, 50 integration points

7_h:
same image selection method, but with 145 images, 50 integration points


8_h:
same image selection method, but with 77 images, 50 integration points


9_h:
same as 6_h, but with 30 integration points

10_h:
same as 6_h, but with 80 integration points and 163 images

11_h:
50 integration points, 700 iterations, 100 images selected as in 6_h, with larger std. dev. on the intial position of the walkers.

12_h:
same as 11_h but with 1400 (2X) iterations

13_h:
700 iterations, 20 walkers, half the images, similar to 12_h
