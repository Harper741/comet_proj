1-4
trials with the first 100 images, no further criteria

5_h:
100, drawn by sorting the images in order of increasing RA then getting every 13th image so they will be spread out in RA, 50 integration points

6_h:
100, drawn by sorting the images in order of increasing RA then getting every 13th image so they will be spread out in RA, but we converted the walkersâ€™ starting points to km rather than AU, which corrects a mistake, 50 integration points

7_h:
same image selection method, but with 145 images, 50 integration points


8_h:
same image selection method, but with 77 images, 50 integration points


9_h:
same as 6_h, but with 30 integration points

10_h:
same as 6_h, but with 80 integration points and 163 images
